# Astar-algorithm
A is the most popular choice in route search because it is quite flexible and can be used in a variety of situations. Like other graph search algorithms, Algorithm A potentially searches a large area in the graph. Like Dijkstra, A can be used to search for the shortest path. Like BFS, A can use heuristic functions. In simple cases, it is as fast as the best search algorithm. In the case of a concave obstacle, A finds a path as good as Dijkstra's algorithm:
